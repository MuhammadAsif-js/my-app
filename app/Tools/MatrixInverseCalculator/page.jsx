                What is the Inverse of a Matrix?

                    Before diving into the intricacies of matrix inversion,
                    let's grasp the fundamental concept. An inverse of a matrix
                    is like its mathematical counterpart , capable of undoing
                    operations performed on the original matrix. If you multiply
                    a matrix by its inverse, you get the identity matrixâ€”a
                    crucial concept in linear algebra.
                  </p>
                  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-600">
                    Left and Right Inverses
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    Understanding left and right inverses adds depth to your
                    knowledge. A left inverse of a matrix \( A \) is another
                    matrix \( B \) such that \( BA = I \), where \( I \) is the
                    identity matrix. Similarly, a right inverse is a matrix \( C
                    \) where \( AC = I \). However, not all matrices have both
                    left and right inverses; some may have none, while others
                    might possess only one type of inverse.
