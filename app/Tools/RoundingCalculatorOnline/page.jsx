                    Before delving into the intricacies of the Rounding
                    Calculator, let's explore the various rounding methods used
                    in mathematical calculations. Understanding these methods
                    lays the foundation for accurate rounding practices.
                    Rounding methods encompass techniques such as: <br /> -
                    Round Half Up/Down: Rounding to the nearest whole number,
                    with 0.5 rounded up or down accordingly.
                    <br />- Round Half Away from Zero: Similar to Round Half Up,
                    but with 0.5 always rounded away from zero. <br />- Round
                    Half to Even/Odd: Rounding to the nearest even or odd
                    integer, commonly used in statistical analysis to reduce
                    bias.
