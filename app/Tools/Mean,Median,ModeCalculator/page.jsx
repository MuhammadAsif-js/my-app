                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
                  - **Mean:** The mean additionally called the standard, stands for the main worth of a dataset computed by including all worths along
 with separating by the
variety of worths. <br />
- **Median:** The mean is the center worth in a sorted dataset. In instances of an also variety of worths it's the standard of both center worths. <br />
- **Mode:** The setting is the regularly happening worth in a dataset.

                  Computing the mean includes a number of crucial actions to guarantee precision: <br />
1. **Sum all worths:** Add up all the worths in the dataset. <br />
2. **Count the variety of worths:** Determine the overall variety of worths in the dataset. <br />
3. **Calculate the mean:** Divide the amount of worths by the variety of worths.

                  ### How to Find the Median: Sorting and also Identifying the Middle Value
To locate the mean, adhere to these actions: <br />
1. **Sort the dataset:** Arrange the worths in climbing or coming down order. <br />
2. **Identify the center worth:** If the dataset has a weird variety of worths the mean is the center worth. If it has an also variety of worths 
the mean is the standard of both center worths
