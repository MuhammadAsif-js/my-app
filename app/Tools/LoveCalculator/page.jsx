                    The Love Calculator has gained popularity as a fun and
                    intriguing tool to estimate the compatibility and love
                    percentage between individuals. While it's not based on

                    how this calculator operates: <br />
                    <p className=" font-semibold mb-2">
                      Example 1: - **Names:** John and Emily - **Love
                      Percentage:** 85% - **Result:** This indicates a strong
                      affection and compatibility level between John and Emily,
                      according to the Love Calculator's algorithm. <br />

                      Percentage:** 42% - **Result:** The lower percentage
                      suggests a lesser compatibility score between Michael and
                      Sarah, as per the Love Calculator's calculations. <br />
                      Example 3: - **Names:** Daniel and Jessica - **Love

                    Romantic love involves intense emotions, passion, and a deep

                    sexual involvement. It emphasizes companionship, mutual
                    respect, and emotional support
