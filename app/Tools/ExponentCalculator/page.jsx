              Exponents are like the magic wands of math, making repeated
              multiplication a breeze. They're super important across various
              math areas like algebra and calculus. In this guide, we'll dive
              deep into exponents, covering their notation, rules, and how
              they're practically used.

                    Exponent notation is like a math shorthand for saying
                    "multiply this number by itself this many times." It has two
                    parts: the base number being multiplied and the exponent
                    showing how many times it's being multiplied. For example,
                    in \(2^3\), the base is 2 and the exponent is 3, so it's \
                    (2 \times 2 \times 2\).

                    Exponent Calculation Examples
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    Let's walk through some examples to really grasp how
                    exponents roll: <br />
                    <span className=" font-semibold">
                      Example 1: Multiplying Exponents <br />
                      When you multiply numbers with the same base but different
                      exponents, just add the exponents together. So, \(2^3
                      \times 2^4\) becomes \(2^{3 + 4}
                      = 2^7\), which is 128. <br />
                      Example 2: Dividing Exponents <br />
                      Dividing numbers with the same base and different
                      exponents? Easy-peasy, just subtract the exponents. Like
                      \(3^5 \div 3^2\) turns into \(3^{5 - 2}
                      = 3^3\), giving us 27. <br />
                      Example 3: Radical of Exponent <br />
                      To take the radical of an exponent, do the opposite of
                      raising to a power. So, the square root of \(4^2\) is \(4^
                      {2 / 2} = 4^1\), simply 4. <br />
                      Example 4: Negative Exponent <br />A negative exponent
                      flips the base and makes the exponent positive. Like \(5^
                      {-3}\) turns into \(\frac{1}
                      {5 ^ 3}\), which is \(\frac{1}
                      {125}\) or 0.008. <br />
                      Example 5: Zero Exponent <br />
                      Any number to the power of 0 is always 1, no matter the
                      base. So, \(7^0\) equals 1 because math says so.

                  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-600">
                    Exponents Laws and Rules
                  </h2>
                  <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-700">
                    Knowing the rules of the exponents game is key for tackling
                    tricky math problems: <br />
                    {/* Multiplying Exponents <br />
                    When you multiply two exponents with the same base, just add
                    their exponents. For example, \(a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}
                    \). <br /> */}
                    {/* Dividing Exponents <br />
                    Dividing two exponents with the same base? Subtract the
                    divisor's exponent from the dividend's exponent. Like
                    \(\frac{a ^ m}
                    {a ^ n} = a^{m - n}\). <br /> */}
                    {/* Power of Exponent <br />
                    To raise an exponent to another exponent, multiply them. So,
                    \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\). Radical of Exponent <br />
                    Taking the nth root of an exponent is like the opposite of
                    raising to a power. For instance, \((a^m)^{1 / n} = a^
                    {m / n}\), where \(n\) is the root. <br />
                    Negative Exponent <br />A negative exponent switches the
                    base and makes the exponent positive. For example, \(a^{
                      -n
                    }{" "}
                    = \frac{1}
                    {a ^ n}\). <br /> */}
                    Zero Exponent <br />
                    Anything to the power of 0 equals 1. It's like math's way of
                    saying "start from scratch." So, \(a^0 = 1\), always.
